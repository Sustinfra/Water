Arduino controlled water payment software

Acces to affordable water, energy and information with open source technology

Billons of people around the world have limited access to clean and affordable water, energy and information. This community uses open-source soft- and hardware to develop monitoring and control systems. In this way water, energy and information service can be connected to digital forms of payment.

These systems are currently based on Arduino hardware.

Over large parts of the world, humans have inadequate access to potable water and use sources contaminated with disease vectors, pathogens or unacceptable levels of toxins or suspended solids. Drinking or using such water in food preparation leads to widespread acute and chronic illnesses and is a major cause of death and misery in many countries. Reduction of waterborne diseases is a major public health goal in developing countries. [2]

Akvopedia gives an overview of open-source methods to access, process, and distribute water.

Goal: develop an Arduino controlled water payment system with the following features.

    Call the 'tap' to open valve and deliver water. (something like this: [4]
    Opload water credits for customer x via mobile payment SMS. [5]
    Subtract x amounth of water credits from customer x for x liter of water
    Sync Arduino status with MySQL database via GSM 

Publick code is available at Github.
